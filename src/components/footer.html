	How Canadian is your Geographic Location?
</h1>
<p>
Has a friend called into question the Americanness of your hometown? Have you been accused of being a <em>Canadian</em>? There are many factors to Canadianness, to be sure, but one predictor is <em>distance from the US-Canada border.</em> Plug in the names of two geographic locations, (town names, street addresses---it's Google maps so it can find anything), then click "Measure Distance to Border" to compare the distances.
